Different sotrage solutions have different metadata capability.
a single hard drive devices with a basic file system has a basic set
of metadata capabilityes. for example, a hard drive with an ext3 filesystem
can withhold the following type of metadata:
- fs inode relative data
- client visible metadata, common attributes which include timestamp, creation time, file size, etc
- file or folder ownership and applied permissions

other more advanced filesystems such as xfs, jfs & zfs are capable of supporting extended attributes.
the characteristics of the extended attributes varies per solution. in such a case, the following
types of metadata would exist:
- fs inode relative data
- client visible metadata, common attributes which include timestamp, creation time, file size, etc
- file or folder ownership and applied permissions
- extended attribues

windows NTFS filesystem has the capability of supporting the common metadata in addition to supporting
alternate data streams, hence extended attributes. 

Apple AFS filesystem has the capability of supporting the common metadata in addition to supporting
resource forking (multiple forking, a.k.a. alternate data streams).

More advanced filesystems that exist on purpose intended NAS solutions pertain additional metadata.
These filesystems store more extensive filesystem details related to the available capabilities and
capability state per object in the propriatary filesystems. Such solutions would have the following
collective metadata:
- fs inode relative data
- client visible metadata, common attributes which include timestamp, creation time, file size, etc
- file or folder ownership and applied permissions
- extended attribues
- advanced fs feature capability state data

Some file types pertain the capability of retaining application specific metadata such as user session
and activity on a file. MS word and excel are of the few that are capable of retaining such metadata.

Some applications retain a separate database where application workflow relative metadata is retained.
